# DialBox

This is a small project to work on an esoteric dial box that was recovered from
the psychology building at FSU.

The dial box has a single wiki-page with some information on the connection. 

[Dial boxes @ yehar.com](http://yehar.com/blog/?p=3471)

A webarchive page is [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190619162708/http://yehar.com/blog/?p=3471) -just in case

and there is another wikipedia page that sports the same images and includes
some links to bits of code that will run the dial box.

I was interested in (and copied) the python code located in the wayback
machine here -->  [Python Script](https://web.archive.org/web/20071001121945/http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~emsley/coot/mbox-2004-2005/att-0547/eventio.py)

There is also an SGI dial box pinout located at [SGI dial box](https://web.archive.org/web/20071016051441/http://www.meadow.net/pinouts.html#sgidbox)
